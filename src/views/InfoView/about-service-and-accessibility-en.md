The Service Map contains information on public service locations (for example, schools, daycare centres and health stations) in the cities of Espoo, Helsinki, Kauniainen and Vantaa, in addition to the wellbeing services counties of Western Uusimaa, Vantaa and Kerava.

The Service Map also provides information on other services, such as HUS hospital network x-ray units, sports and recreations services in the city of Kirkkonummi, HSY recycling points, Aalto University and other governmental services. The Service Map also shows several private services via the City Platform service.

Click the small x inside the search field to clear the search. Click the arrow within the search field to return to the previous search. If your search results come up empty, please check your search words for typos and your city setting.

### Your search results can be arranged in:

- alphabetical order, A–Ö
- reversed alphabetical order Ö–A
- most accessible first
- closest first (give permission to locate you)

If you have indicated a sensory processing issue (for example, 'I use a hearing aid'), a search will automatically rank the most accessible services first (in this example, those services that provide an induction loop). If you switch off this kind of map setting, your search engine ranking order will may change.

If you give the Service Map permission to determine your location, a search request will automatically rand the services closest to you first. You can also enter your address in the Service Map manually.

## Address search

You can also write your address in the search field to find services near you. The search field will suggest street names to choose from, and after you have selected one, it will suggest specific addresses. The Service Map also generates certain area suggestions for Helsinki locations (for example, school catchment areas).
